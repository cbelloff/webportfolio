          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Carly Belloff, a Sophomore at the University of Michigan. I hope that my web portfolio will be useful in helping others get to know who I am. I recently was accepted into the School of Information  that focuses on the intersection of people, information, and technology. While I know there is an information analysis path and a user experience design path, I am excited to explore my options through taking various courses in the future. Likewise, I have almost completed the Digital Studies minor that focuses on the role that digital media and other forms of technology play in US culture. I am enrolled in the Digital Media Club where I am able to communicate and network with like minded individuals, as there are guest speakers, meetings, and presentations on new technologies such as adobe illustrator and photoshop. I am also an active member of Challah for Hunger, Project Sunshine, Protect Child Abuse America, Go Blue Wear Pink, and Relay for Life.

          <h2>Experiences</h2>
          <p>I worked for Reliable Power Alternatives Corporation for two summers. RPAC is a company that purchases electricity for big commercial companies. I worked with an API called weather bug to retrieve different temperatures in different areas for analysts to see how weather affects energy prices. Additionally, I monitored and helped update the website called <a href= http://www.rpac.net>rpac.net</a>. I monitored this website by validating that all the links worked properly and helped update the site by sitting in on all the meetings to help pick out the new designs. Similarly, I reviewed the content that competitors were displaying on their sites and presented it to the team, so they had an idea of what to add to their site. For example, RPACs old website did not previously have a page called ‘what our clients say,’ but when I saw it on a bunch of their competitor’s websites, they added quotes from some of their clients. This summer, I will be working in Canon’s Digital Marketing Services Division where I will help the team with web content development.

          <h2>Qualifications</h2>
          <p>My classes here at the University of Michigan deal with either the social or technical aspects of the digital world where I am learning to develop skills in Python, Sublime Editor, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, MS Excel, etc. For example, Introduction to Information Studies is where I learned what information is and how humans construct it as well as the basic architectures of computing and networks. Similarly, in the course Programs, Information, and People, I learned how people coordinate with each other on software development, how to use Python, and how to process data traces of people’s actions and interactions. For example, I wrote a program that uses the APIs of Carma, a carpooling application, to see how many people are looking for rides, as well as Uber, to see how many Uber drivers there are in each of the major cities in the CSV file I created. Based on the ratio I created between Carma Users and Uber drivers, if there are significant amounts of people looking for rides in certain cities and little Uber drivers in those cities, then my program will illustrate that Uber would benefit from increasing the amount of drivers that they have working in those cities. Similarly, my first level writing course on the Age of Social Media taught me how to write blogs based on different expectations that audiences have depending on the platform being used. I provided the content for the website <a href=http://www.socialmediaawareness.org>socialmediaawareness.org</a> in order to inform and quiz social media users about their privacy on various social media sites. I am currently enrolled in Agile Web Development, which is giving me the skills to create this portfolio, as I am taught how to create web pages using HTML, style them using CSS, and making my portfolio as accessible and responsive as possible.

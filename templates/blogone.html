<h1>Social Realism in FPS Games</h1>
<p>
Imagine playing a video game with content in parallel with your social beliefs in real life. The video game becomes more than just a game, but reality, with a reaffirmation of social issues that are near and dear to you. Galloway would call such an experience social realism, “a congruence between the social reality depicted in the game and the social reality known and lived by the player” (83). Galloway goes further and explains that “a typical American youth playing Special Force (a game published by Hezbollah that is played from a young Palestinian’s perspective) is most likely not experiencing realism, whereas realism is indeed possible for a young Palestinian gamer playing Special Force,” therefore implying that social realism only applies to particular players who can relate to particular experiences and social beliefs in a game (84). While I believe that most FPS games do not contain social realism unless there is a deeper meaning involved such as the Palestinian game that focused on defeating the Israeli Defense Forces, I believe that FPS games that do contain social realism also brings about a feeling of disidentification as discussed by Josh in lecture because there are aspects of these games that players can identify with, but there are also aspects that distance them at the same time. For example, I am able to identify with FPS games that deal with terrorism because I can relate to issues in today’s society, illustrating that these particular games encompass social realism, but at the same time, the fact that I am not trying to kill everyone in sight distances me from these FPS games as well.

Because Triple A industries care more about making money by selling entertaining games than reflecting real life experiences, many FPS games do not contain social realism. However, these games can still be realistic as Galloway describes realisticness as how a game looks without taking into account experience. For example, Atari’s BattleZone was deemed so realistic by the US military due to its representation and interactive 3D environment that they hired Atari to build a special version used to train tank pilots (73). While these games may accurately represent what war looks like, they cannot accurately capture the social realities of players without social realism as well.

Similar to social realism, André Bazin defined realism in the cinema as “a technique to approximate the basic phenomenological qualities of the real world not simply realistic visual representation … [but] also real life in all its dirty details, hopeful desires, and abysmal defeats” (74). These techniques include the use of nonprofessional actors, the absence of histrionics, real-life scenery, amateur cinematography, grainy film stock, long takes, and minimal editing. These techniques help make movies more relatable to the average viewers because they can help strengthen the depiction of real life experiences such as terrorist attacks or other events that some identify with because they lived through it, have a similar opinion, or can relate to the message in some way. In addition to these techniques, the subjective shot as described by Galloway in “Origins of the First Person Shooter” has the ability to display what the actual eyes of a character would see, making it easier to show the social realities of its viewers. While both of these techniques can be used in video games also, I personally believe that I would more easily relate to the social struggles in movies because the message would be stronger to me coming from real people as opposed to avatars, and my experience would be enhanced coming from the realism of a camera rather than a gaming console.

Based on the story requirements of FPS games, the players are typically men because an all female military team would not be realistic. Therefore, women avatars are typically excluded as a gender in these FPS, but they are still able to enjoy, play, and relate to these games. However, some individuals believe that FPS games are designed for a male user base and as a result women of color are facing abuse in games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Gears of War through Xbox Live as discussed by Kishonna Gray in “Collective Organizing, Individual Resistance, or Asshole Griefers?” With Xbox Live being mostly an audio-visual community, women of color are constantly facing linguistic stereotypes based on their accents and dialects where they are called bitches and spics. As a result, women use resources available to them to their advantage where they resist, ignore, oppose, and protest the abuse, but males usually respond with things like “Mute her ass” and Xbox overlooks this behavior, ignores complaints, suspends the women, and deletes complaints from their forums.

While FPS games result in intra-mechanic conflict based on the shooting mechanic itself, extra-mechanic conflict can just as easily occur due to conflict with player’s cultures and norms similar to the conflict women face in Xbox live. For example, verbal abuse can occur when players partake in unwritten rules of engagement (netiquette) such as camping where players hide behind objects in order to avoid getting shot as well as because of player’s gamer tags such as ‘GayBoy’ who was tortured as shown in lecture. Additionally, within FPS games themselves, women can face benevolent sexism where men may feel they are being chivalrous when protecting women from other shooters, but this just leads to sexist attitudes, portraying women as weak and incapable. Unfortunately, these remarks and attitudes are all realistic in everyday life as we live in a world with an abundance of racism and sexism, so having them occur in the game world only adds to the realism of the experience in the game.

Before this assignment, I have never played a FPS game that was more than the shootings in GTA:SA and I was surprised to find one that I was able to relate to: Wolfenstein 3D. Not only did the swastikas around the Nazi prison in this game help set a realistic representation of the game, but also I was able to relate to it because my great grandparents came from Germany and part of my family was killed by the Nazis. While I experienced social realism in this game because I was reminded of my ancestors, I also think disidentification occurred as I was definitely distanced by the archaic environment of the game as well as its shooting aspect. However, I was unable to experience social realism in ImmorTall mostly because you play as an alien who is protecting a family during a war and I am unable to relate to an alien as well as the other aspects of this game. Likewise, I did not relate to experiences in Call of Duty Black Ops 2, and as the commercial states “there is a soldier in all of us,” yet this game did not feel realistic because I did not automatically die when I was shot and I was unable to relate to any aspects of this particular version’s narrative.

	Discussion Questions:

	While writing this blog a couple of interesting discussion questions came to mind.
	<p>
	1)The game Special Force is a FPS game based on the armed Islamic movement in South Lebanon that promotes the killing of Israeli Defense Forces by Hezbollah and contains anti-Israeli iconography. I interpret such acts of violence towards Jews as a form of anti-Semitism. Should there be an ethical obligation by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to curtail such hatred?
	</p>

	<p>
	2)Virtual reality technology is now able to educate users on a vast array of subject matters. The problem is, where does one draw the line on how gaming content should be enforced? For example, these FPS games teach you how to shoot a gun, but should there be intervention if games teach you how to build a bomb? Both teach how to take lives, yet at what point should there be intervention?

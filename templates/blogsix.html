<h1>The Negative Stigma of Video Games</h1>

As a non-gamer with few experiences in the gaming community, I immediately found the video game culture surrounding GTA San Andreas a bit disturbing. Applying the video game analysis model constructed by Latorre, my initial impressions were that this game not only consisted of a culture that caters to males and degrades women, but also encourages violence and stereotypes of minorities. This model allowed me to examine “the relationship between game design, the transmission of ideological values, and the construction of social reality” in GTA San Andreas based on the analysis of the character/player, the game world, and the main actions carried out in the game (Latorre 415).

The main character of GTA San Andreas is Carl Johnson (CJ) who returns home to Los Santos after his mother’s murder and as a result must help restore order amongst his old friends and family. CJ not only has to reestablish his gang in hopes to gain lost territory, but he also faces interactions with corrupt police and criminals. In order for CJ to carry out these goals, he must follow the state rules of the game that require him to maintain a certain level of hunger and exercise. Therefore, to get the money needed to stay healthy, the performance rules allow CJ to easily steal cars, use various weapons, and run extra fast. Bogost would agree that the procedure of the game based on these rules such as the easy access to crime is what persuades the players to participate in criminal activities as the game does not reward those who abide by the law, calling this the game’s “procedural rhetoric.” Therefore, I am not a fan of the game mechanics that glorify car racing and shootings in an illegal way to carry out actions that only strengthen stereotypes of minorities.

In addition to the player, the game world, according to Latorre, “is composed of the environment where the game takes place plus the 'inhabitants' of this environment, basically non-player characters, objects, and natural or cultural elements” (Latorre 422). In GTA San Andreas, the game world is based on the state of San Andreas where I noticed that when I drove to nicer parts of cities, there were mostly white citizens who almost never shot at you, drove expensive cars, and were businessmen (when I stole their cars they had briefcases). However, when you went back to poorer neighborhoods, there tended to be more black and Mexican gang members with an abundance of violence and more policemen. It is in these poorer areas where I would see prostitutes walking the streets dressed in bras and high heels as well as stripper clubs with scantily dressed girls. Not only does portraying women in revealing clothes degrade them in the game itself, but it also objectifies women outside the game world. I was also shocked at the extent of stereotypes that were reinforced when a black character with a thick accent dressed in a wife beater and baggy jeans steals, kills, and gets weed from Mexican drug dealers.

After examining game play activities when using the video game analysis model, the struggles of disadvantaged minorities are present. While it seems that the players in the game are capable of making their own decision, people living in the poorer areas of San Andreas are persuaded to partake in a culture where they must commit murders, be in a gang, associate themselves with drugs, steal, etc. in order to obtain a sufficient amount of money that the game rule design requires you to have. Therefore, based on the game’s procedure, it gets players to think that they have so much freedom, but they are actually limited as the game establishes what can and cannot be done. For example, the game only lets you enter certain buildings after you complete a mission, making the buildings you cannot enter more dull, so the players do not notice their lack of freedom.

Nevertheless, Shaw’s article, What is Video Game Culture, asserts that we should not look at traditional definitions of video game culture, as I used in my analysis of GTA, but instead look at who plays video games, how they play, and what they play. Because the definition of culture is so vast, by defining those three questions, one can derive the impact of a video game on mainstream culture. In today’s digital world there is no definition of what a gamer should look like. The face of the gamer can still be young or old, black or white, male or female, and from any part of the globe. Video game play also has no particular road map that one could follow. There are video gamers that are addicted to games and take on the persona of a character which their life revolves around, there are gamers that enjoy the social aspect of multi-player interaction, there are those that like the competition, and those that just like the entertainment value that a game has to offer. And when it comes to what to play, the library of games are enormous. There are sports games, war games, role-playing games, fantasy games, etc. So when you look at how video games affect a person, the question that needs to be asked is how that translates in affecting society and thus the various cultures around the world. For this reason, Shaw points out how video game culture influences popular culture and therefore “we should look at video games in culture rather than games as culture” (Shaw 416).

These readings bring to mind the cultural ramifications on our society by video games that can be seen daily and are impactful both positively and negatively. In December of 2012, twenty elementary students were murdered by a shooter who politicians, the media, and pundits blamed violent video games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto for his actions. Regardless if right or wrong, those who believe video games cause violent actions are responsible for a cultural shift in gun control, security, and education. However, there are studies that show video games are good for the brain, may slow the aging process, may help dyslexic kids, and improve eyesight. All of which can effect society and our culture in a positive way. So the question that one should ask is:

In a video game culture where you take on a different persona, can that become someone’s reality that can be harmful to the gamer and society?

In today’s modern warfare of drones and robotics, are gamers the new military might? Would experts in Call of Duty or GTA be good in today’s modern military?

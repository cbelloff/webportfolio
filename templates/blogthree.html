<h1>Virtual Hate</h1>

In today’s world there are people from all walks of life that are haters. There are racists, anti-Semites, anit-gays and for whatever reason were born to hate. They come from a dark place that perpetuates a venom that degrades our society. Unfortunately, this hatred has manifested over the Internet and into the gaming community. It even seems to be more prevalent through the web since there is a high level of anonymity and therefore these cowards can spew their hate-mongering without fear of reprisal.

Some individuals in the video gaming community contribute to the racist banter because the gaming developers seem to be catering to a white male audience. For marketing purposes this is the demographic that is the user majority, however, for those black or Latino minorities to play a game and not have access to an avatar similar to who they are, or have an avatar that is poorly stereotyped, can be construed as insensitive and racist. In the article “Minority Report: The Non-White Gamer’s Experience,” Owen Good writes that “Hardwiring a minority character into a game, without stereotype, is a powerful statement, above any game that allows customizable avatars of any ethnicity.” In other words, in GTA, if minorities were depicted as businessmen or people of social means instead of as Latino drug dealers or black gang member, then this would be a very impactful and encouraging statement that would change people’s perceptions of minorities in the game world and as a result the youth of our society in the real world as well. According to Good, as Williams the researcher sums up, "People are probably not going to opt in and say, ‘I've got my squad, but I really need a black guy. I really need a Hispanic guy on it.' They're probably going to create guys who look like themselves." For this reason, the lack of avatar choices only fuels frustration among minority gamers and segregates it’s users by race thus creating an atmosphere similar to racial discrimination of the 1950’s and 60’s. In the article “Video Games’ Race Problem Goes All The Way to the Top” by Sidney Fussell, he points out that asking “are video games racist?” aligns players with the storied racism of slave owners and the Ku Klux Klan. And as racism has evolved since then, so must our tactics to unearth and combat it. I agree with Fussell’s conclusion that “the ultimate goal of asking if games are racist is not more brown characters stuck in the sidekick ghetto. It is crafting a medium capable of offering playable experiences as diverse — and imaginative — as its users.”

Nevertheless, no matter what multiplayer game you play, you will always see rude, vulgar, and racist remarks. Playing a video game should be fun and free from troglodytes and racists. In the article “Video Game Racism: The Fault of the Games or the Players?” Tom Meltzer points to a study that “followed a group of African American gamers whose voices and use of language identified them as black to other players. It found they suffered racial abuse on a daily basis." This is unacceptable and unfortunately needs to be policed by a moderator of the gaming site. Meltzer then makes a great point: “don’t hate the game, hate – and censor and ban – the player.” While there is a responsibility on the developer to create a hate free environment so gamers can enjoy the video game without having to deal with ethnic slurs, it is up to the gamer to report any malicious or racist behavior from other users. Unfortunately, with a lot of VoIP (voice over internet protocol) in today’s online games, it may be difficult to prove guilt, but if enough users complain and the gaming site begins to track user complaints, we may be able to get back to a video gaming environment that is fun and doesn’t have negative effects on its users.

In addition, hateful remarks can affect ones life outside the gaming community especially when these comments are life-threatening. In the article “5 Things I Learned as the Internet’s Most Hated Person” by Zoe Quinn, you can see the negative impact that online or virtual hate can have on a person’s life. Zoe Quinn is a video game developer who had a negative story appear on the Internet, which propagated to the point where it affected her real life, the life of her family, and that of her friends. Whether the story about Zoe was true or not, the malicious verbal attacks on her life were criminal. As Zoe stated, “This sort of thing is hardly new -- forums like 4chan organize campaigns every month or so to try to stick it to feminists or just women in general.” This behavior reinforces the need for action to be taken so the Internet and online gaming does not become a breeding ground for hate-mongering that can ultimately be hazardous to individuals in the real world as seen in the death threats Zoe Quinn received when her date of death was created on Wikipedia.

After further analysis, I believe that both the gaming platforms and the players are at fault in creating a digital society that unfortunately is similar to the real world. Developers must be considerate of minorities playing their game and stop catering to a mostly, all white user base. However, players also need to leave their racist back-world views at home and enjoy the freedoms that a video game provides. It is unfortunate that a few bad apples can pollute our digital society and give way to totalitarianism in the gaming world.

As I was writing this blog, two discussion questions came to mind: who decides if a video game is inappropriate, for example, if Isis was to create a video game to recruit Jihadists, should it be allowed? The second question is: should society’s laws pertaining to hate crimes carry over to online gaming and the Internet?

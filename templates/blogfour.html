<h1>The Negative Stigma of Video Games</h1>

<p>
The negative stigma of video games is based on peoples’ perceptions of games as well as gamers, as some view games as a media where white nerdy teenage boys sit in an isolated room eating Fritos, leading to no useful or educational benefits, but only promoting violence. With this perspective, games are viewed as risky and problematic due to the content in the games themselves as well as how gamers interact with the games and each other. Some critics even go as far as blaming mass school shootings on video games alone such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

Some of this disapproval is due to video game’s procedural rhetoric, which Egenfeldt describes in his chapter “Video Games in Culture” to be “the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions (typically in games) rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures” (161). For example, critics do not approve of the violent procedural rhetoric in games like Death Race 2000 where a player is persuaded to run over gremlins because it is the only way to gain points and therefore be successful in the game. For this reason, critics say games have a negative fiction because they believe games lead to aggressive behavior as players are persuaded to partake in crime, and as a result they consider games low culture media. While games with positive fiction do not lead to aggression, critics believe that there are not many games that fall into this category, as Professor Nakamura even experienced violent remarks through chats on games like Words with Friends.

In order to accurately study the reactions that gamers have to games such as Death Race 2000 in determining if it is the game itself that is leading to the gamer’s aggressive behavior, one can use an active media perspective or an active user perspective, which is described by Egenfeldt in his chapter “Video Games and Risks.” Egenfeldt states, “in the active media perspective, video games are conceived as having a direct, objective, and measurable effect on players” (Egenfeldt, 275). For example, if a player was aggressive after playing Death Race 2000, the active media perspective would say that it is directly the fault of the media causing this reaction. To contrast, Egenfeldt describes an active user perspective as when “video games do not have the same effect on everybody but are mediated by a variety of factors such as playing context, genre expectations, and the individual player’s interpretation,” which I believe to be more accurate than an active media perspective (Egenfeldt, 275). For example, an active user perspective would take into account other variables to explain a player’s aggression such as life experiences like a car accident, which can be a reason for the player’s aggression when running over gremlins in Death Race 2000. Also, the game mechanics could be frustrating and thus lead to aggressive maneuvering of the vehicle, so this frustration was due to pushing buttons on a controller, but not the message in the game itself.

Nevertheless, this aggression that is contributing to the negative stigma of games or other reactions to games can come from conflict in or outside of the game. For example, intra-mechanic conflict is conflict that is “shaped by the actual game code,” including first person shooter games and most strategy games (Egenfeldt, “Games in Culture”, 184). However, extra-mechanic conflict is conflict “which does not stem from the rules of the game itself,” but instead is conflict between the culture and norms between the players (184). For example, in “Bow Nigger,” the opponent of Always_Black attacked him when he was bowing. While it is not required to bow before every game, it is part of the norms to do so. Therefore, this disrespect in breaking the norms brought about an outside conflict of good vs. evil.

As a result of the reactions to these types of conflicts, games can lead to the general arousal theory that will definitely strengthen their negative stigma. As seen in the YouTube videos shown in class about gamer rage, games can be considered affective technologies as they produce many emotions and sensations like being happy, sad, submissive or aggressive. Likewise, general arousal theory can lead to the use of racial slurs and hate comments because when a player plays a game their level of arousal is increased, which also increases their level of intensity in their actions, so when they die or experience conflict in a game or with other players, they release this level of intensity. While this does not justify any aggressive or negative behaviors that take place outside or inside the game world, it does explain it.

As a result of the negative stigma of video games based on game’s procedural rhetorics, negative fictions, use of active media perspectives, conflicts in the game, and the general arousal theory, game regulation was created. After Death Race 2000 came out in 1994, the ESRB (Entertainment Software Ratings Board) was founded because of its violent content. While ESRB is like all other rating systems, it states that “experience may change during game play” as it is hard to regulate online networking and gamers can be very creative. However, Klijkwijzer, a Dutch media rating system, does a better job of rating games because it includes icons to show if games are sexist, racist, or homophobic or if they use drugs or have scary content etc.

<p>
I believe that video game content is just an online media show, which is no different than the content of a movie or TV show. Movies have a rating system and before the creation of online games, critics accused Hollywood of producing aggressive movies that lead to violence in today’s society. It’s the same argument but just a different medium. Today’s world is filled with war, violence, sex but it is also filled with love and peace. If an individual takes an aggressive path, there are many medicating psychological factors, so blaming video games by using perspectives like the active media perspective is ignorant because they are not the heart of his or her problem.

<p>
Two questions that come to mind while writing this blog are; before the advent of video games, how many horrific crimes were attributable to violence in movies. The second question is; what are the similarities or differences between the ESRB and CARA (Classification and Ratings Administration) used in films and how does this moral censorship affect our society.

<h1>The Negative Stigma of Video Games</h1>

<p class='blogtext'>
Since the creation of the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972, the first home gaming console, games’ intended audience was families. However, as time went on games quickly became gendered, which can be seen starting from the establishment of arcades. For example, Carly Kocurek discusses the history of arcades in her ‘Coin Operated Americans’ and how they “were frequented not by the punks in leather jackets who lurked around pool halls but by bright young boys with a penchant for technology” (Kocurek 1). While some studies show that 40% of the coin drop on Atari’s Pong came from women, this can solely be a result of its initial placement in bars as opposed to arcades, as these arcades were catered towards young heterosexual white males. For this reason, the history of the arcades helped create a technomasculine world where men dominated the technology industry. In addition to the history of arcades, this technomasculinity can be seen by the name of the gameBOY alone as well as in PC Gamer (a magazine for gamers) where “Game Gods” was the title of the cover in 1999, as the term goddesses was no where to be found.

As more games continue to be created and the game industry is quickly expanding, Shaw noticed and discussed in “Do You Identify as a Gamer?” that men were a lot more likely to identify as gamers than women. While some women felt that they did not play enough to be considered a gamer, others felt that it was what they played that made them not be able to ‘count’ as a gamer. For example, some women believed that they fell within the stereotypical casual player due to the platforms they played on such as the Nintendo Wii where one is believed to have “a preference for positive and pleasant fictions, has played few video games, is willing to commit small amounts of time and resources towards playing video games, and dislikes games” as opposed to hardcore gamers that play platforms like Xbox or FPS games and “will invest large amounts of time and resources toward playing video games, and enjoys difficult games” (Shaw, 30). Likewise, the creation of pink games as well as Brenda Laurel’s Purple Moon Games, a company that made pink games, created a games for girls movement that reinforced these stereotypes as these games were overly girly, emotional, and sexist and therefore basically stated that girls would not enjoy more popular action-oriented games that are associated with men such as hardcore games.

Additionally, women may not identify as gamers in order to avoid harassment. For example, women who like to play games and are attractive can be viewed as trying to impress boys while women who are unattractive can be seen as nerds. Likewise, women face harassment within the games they play (documented on fatuglyslutty.com) and this can be due to the way women are represented in the game world. For example, when women are seen in GTA San Andreas, they are almost always stripers. Likewise, even from the start of video games before there were even efficient graphics such as Tomb Raider, women were depicted with overly big breasts and wearing short shorts, which can lead to comments that Amanda Cote shared in lecture such as when a boy stated that he wanted to “rip her breasts to bloody shreds.” Also, Ji Firepaw in WoW greets women by creepily calling them gorgeous, but greets men normally by stating that they are strong. The stereotypes that occur in the game world affects women in the real world as well because people start to believe these stereotypes, as Zoe Quinn was brutally harassed in Gamer Gate and when a women named Anita tried to create a kick start to obtain money to illustrate this treatment of women, the game world responded with a game called ‘Punching Anita’ where she was brutally harassed through gaming.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that women are negatively viewed in and outside of the game world, they still continue to buy and play these games. For this reason, Shaw believes that it is up to the gaming industry to make games more diverse and the responsibility should not be on the consumer to stop buying them because she believes that “if scholars can prove that members of marginalized groups are gamers, the industry will have to offer content that is more diverse,” and this does not mean creating targeted audiences through pink games, but creating equality within video games for all audiences (Shaw, 29). However, if industries just add women into video games or create women avatars, it will not automatically make these games more diverse and therefore not make women more accepted into the game world. Because the gaming industry is a majority of white heterosexual men (as shown in Kixeye’s recruiting advertisement), they are more likely to create avatars and characters that represent themselves, so there are most likely going to be stereotypes when creating characters for women. Therefore, I believe in the concept of ‘nothing about us without us’ and that the only way to make diverse games so women are accurately represented is to hire women in the gaming industry. It would be such a powerful statement to see women hard wired into a video game without any stereotypes as stereotypes can shape people’s beliefs in the real world. While hiring women in the gaming industry in this technomasculine world may be a challenge, I think it is the only way they will be accurately represented in video games, so they can face less harassment and therefore be able to more freely identify as a gamer.

Two questions that come to mind while writing this blog are: does a gender wage gap exist in the gaming industry, similar to the discriminatory wage barrier that exists for women in most occupations today. The second question: is there a correlation between sex crimes against women such as rape, and the criminals having played certain video games that depict sexist stereotypes of women.

<h1>The Negative Stigma of Video Games</h1>




<p class='blogtext'>
Anonymous is an international group of hackers that troll the Internet and use message boards to communicate with each other in order to target government, religious, and corporate websites. Coleman points out in his book that Anonymous’s activism was initially predicated on the lulz. He describes the lulz as “a deviant style of humor and a quasi-mystical state of being [that] evolved with Anonymous from the beginning” (Introduction Page 2). This method of black humor used by Anonymous can best be illustrated by the groups’ 2006 raid of a website called Habbo Hotel. The website, geared to teenagers, allowed users to create avatars and socialize in the hotel. When Anonymous members heard the site was banning users because of the skin color of their avatars, Anonymous users raided the site by creating avatars as black men with afros in gray suits that collectively created a picket line in the form of a swastika and did not allow any other members from entering the hotel’s pool for the lulz of it.

Soon after the Habbo Hotel incident, Anonymous created a logo of a headless man in a black suit.

Another example of lulz in relation to Anonymous was the targeting of the Church of Scientology. Anons (Anonymous members) were upset that the church tried to remove an embarrassing video of Scientologist Tom Cruise from the Internet in January 2008. They viewed this as Internet censorship, and as one Anon stated “the greater Anon community united to unleash a hearty load of fuck you upon Scientology’s entire cult empire” (Introduction page 5). Following the lulz philosophy, Anonymous members unleashed “Project Chanology” which executed DDoS (Denial of Service) attacks on Scientology websites. The group also ordered unpaid pizzas and escorts to Scientology churches as well as barraged their phones with prank calls and their fax machine with nude images. As Anons dove more into the undertaking of Scientology, their findings outraged its members. Soon the media caught on to this battle and abuses perpetrated by the church. Anonymous then aligned itself with Scientology critics and ex-members that eventually gave rise to world-wide protests.

Lulz seems to be synonymous with Anonymous in affecting social change as demonstrated with the Habbo Hotel and Scientology protests because the extreme actions carried out by Anons using humor and digital trickery attract attention that reaches a large audience. These tactics such as shutting down websites produce a calculated chaos that draws media attention to their cause. Therefore, I believe lulz is an effective approach to inform people of global injustice and to help fight for a belief or a struggle to promote justice. There is so much injustice in the world that this methodology used by Anonymous can be considered the new digital revolutionary movement. It is a form of protest and social awareness to the masses. While there is a fine line between promoting social change through legal actions and illegal methods such as DDoS attacks, I do feel that lulz is an effective strategy to foster social awareness and change.

Operation Tunisia took place in 2011 when the Tunisian dictator Ben Ali had censored the Internet, jailed bloggers, and used live ammunition against protestors. This event was mostly ignored by the media, so Anonymous got involved and released DDoS attacks against the Tunisian government websites, posted videos so the outside world can see the plight of the Tunisian people, and gave Tunisian hackers advice on how to conceal their identities online so law enforcement could not detect them.

There was also Operation Antisec that started as a protest against government censorship and internet monitoring. The goal was to expose government, banking, and corporate corruption around the globe. Companies like Paypal and agencies like the CIA and UK’s SOCA (Serious Organised Crime Agency) were hacked. The backlash was a cyber manhunt against the individuals responsible and even though some arrests were made, the Anons were too dispersed and were therefore unable to be found.

Another example of Anonymous’s cyber vigilantism was against Sony. Sony’s PSN network was hacked causing the company millions of dollars because Sony required payment for services that were supposed to be free.

These modern day Robin Hood actions seem to be creating havoc around the world. While I feel some of their intentions appear to be beneficial such as supporting pro-democracy in the Middle East and uncovering injustice around the world, there are repercussions that may harm innocent people such as DDOSing the CIA website or stealing customer data and posting it online for the lulz of it. However, it seems Anonymous has morphed into something more than a group of hackers trying to get cheap laughs or lulz. It has become a group of activists trying to incite real change and they have become real-life revolutionaries. While they are making a difference, I just hope that innocent people are not in the line of fire. As Samuel Adams said “It does not take a majority to prevail… but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.” Long Live the Revolution!

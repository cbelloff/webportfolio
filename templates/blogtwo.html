George Orwell’s novel 1984 discusses a society of public manipulation and government surveillance by a leader called Big Brother. Mat Honan’s article “I Liked Everything I Saw on Facebook for Two Days. Here’s What It Did to Me” has an eerie similarity to 1984. Mat Honan performed a social experiment where he discovered that after clicking on the “like” field on Facebook for every subject matter that appeared on his screen, his content rapidly changed from social information about his friends and family to solely advertisements. For example, as a result of liking one advertisement, four more similar advertisements would appear on his newsfeed and the process continued until he liked over one thousand advertisements. He noticed that his “feed was almost completely devoid of human content.” Therefore, Honan argues that Facebook uses algorithms to determine what shows up in newsfeeds and these excessive amounts of advertisements push people so far into a niche that they can no longer form their own opinion. They basically lead you to path of no return. Not only do these advertisements bombard Honan’s newsfeeds, but they also flood his friends’ newsfeeds as well. While one friend asked “Have you been hacked” another said “My fb feed is literally filled with articles you like, it’s kind of funny.”

Facebook governs what appears on your news feeds and when they appear as in towards the top or bottom. With multiple people being affected by the advertisement likes Honan performs, he assumes his readers are people who also experience an abundant amount of advertisements on Facebook. His purpose in this article is to report to the public how Facebook advertisements are taking over newsfeeds and therefore are manipulating users into opinions that they may not originally believe in. According to a Forbes writer Paul Tassi, in his article “Facebook’s Advertising Is Starting to Spiral Out of Control,” he talks about how an advertisement is always somewhere to be found after every login and about Facebook’s announcement that it has hit one million advertisers using its site (http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/07/01/facebooks-advertising-is-starting-to-spiral-out-of-control/). His audience also includes non-Facebook users who do not use it for reasons such as the excessive information that they do not care to see on their newsfeeds.

The main appeals present in the article are pathos, ethos, and logos. Honan uses an appeal to pathos when he uses humor. While stating the numerous advertisements he liked, he said “I liked fucking Kohl’s. I liked Kohl’s for you.” This appeals to emotions because this statement makes one laugh and smile. I know this made me laugh out loud. Additionally, Honan’s article appeals to ethos because the article is posted in Wired magazine. Therefore, this shows Honan’s authority because his article is posted in a well-known magazine about the effects of technology on society. Similarly, this article appeals to ethos because Andy Warhol is used to help portray the idea that as you do things over and over again such as liking a Facebook advertisement, you will get trapped deeper into a loss of other viewpoints. Warhol is an authoritative figure because he was a leading figure in the creation of pop art. In addition to pathos and ethos, Honan also uses logos to strengthen his argument. He is logical because he is constantly stating facts that occurred as soon as he liked a Facebook post in order to portray evidence. For example, he states the idea that once you like a post about a topic, four more advertisements related to that topic will continuously appear.

In his article, Honan addresses the main argument against his thesis, the idea that Facebook is only providing this excessive amount of advertisements because he excessively likes them so they think he enjoys this information. However, he refutes this argument because he does not believe the problem is that there are a lot of advertisements, but that Facebook only allows people to see these advertisements, which ultimately influences people to form opinions on topics they normally would not. For example, he concludes by making the point that he liked more than a thousand things to his Like page, however, not one of those things he actually liked. Therefore, he now has a newsfeed full of topics and controversies that do not interest him, which is very likely to happen to other Facebook users who are influenced to like certain advertisements for reasons such as manipulation or peer pressure.

Overall I believe the argument Honan makes is effective because he reported his findings in an unbiased way with no exaggeration. For example, he states that his “News Feed had drifted further and further right, so too did it drift further and further left.” Honan is being unbiased because he is not saying anything about politics because he does not imply being on a Conservative, Liberal, or Reform agenda. In addition to being fair-minded, Honan also uses metaphors to strengthen his argument. For example, he compares the idea that Facebook makes one close-minded with being trapped in a rabbit hole when he states “the things we read and watch have become hyper-niche and cater to our specific interests. We go down rabbit holes of special interests until we’re lost in the queen’s garden, cursing everyone above ground.” This is also a reference to Charles Dodgson’s Alice in Wonderland. Likewise, Honan uses anaphora in order to strengthen his argument. For example, he repeats “I liked” in the beginning of multiple sentences in order to reinforce the idea that he liked several posts and advertisements.

So is Facebook the Big Brother from George Orwell’s novel 1984? In January of 2012 Facebook conducted a study on emotional manipulation by sending positive and negative newsfeeds to its viewers  It would be interesting to explore the ethics of digital manipulation and the effect it can have on our society. After all it was only 80 years ago when a German society was manipulated by a man called Adolf Hitler. Can history repeat itself? For my final paper I will expand on the issue of the ethics of digital manipulation and what responsibility Social Media sites should have in relaying unbiased information. To accomplish this assignment I will provide references and gifs to validate the information I will be presenting. Some of the gifs include information about how social media can be compared to a weapon of mass destruction.

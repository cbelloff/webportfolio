I recall an experiment I participated in during a high school math class; the teacher asked the question what is 9 x 7. I immediately knew the answer was 63, however, when the first student answered 62 and the next agreed, and so on, I began to doubt myself and wasn’t sure if I knew the right answer. I therefore said 62. The fact that I conformed to the masses was a bit annoying to me at the time and I swore I would not be a conformist again.

I basically gave in to the famous saying “If everyone jumps off a bridge, does that mean you will too?” because I unfortunately did what everyone else was doing.

I recently watched a video “Wake Me Up” by a DJ known as Avicii. This video, published on July 29th 2013, went viral with over 465 million views. According to Today, Aloe Blacc was responsible for writing and performing “Wake Me Up” and he was inspired by his own life. Additionally, this video won the Teen Choice Awards for Choice EDM song and the Billboard Music Award for Top Dance/ Electronic Song all in 2014. Therefore, “Wake Me Up” is a popular video that is liked by millions of its viewers.

As I watched this video it brought back memories of that high school day where I realized I was a conformist. The video shows two girls, one approximately 20 years old and a much younger girl around 10; it can be assumed that they are sisters. They are both branded with a tattoo of two triangles facing opposite ways. When they walk through their town, the townspeople look at them with distain and disgust. They are surely different and are branded as such. However, one girl out of the crowd of townspeople seems envious of their lifestyle, but doesn’t have the courage to join them. Eventually the older sister leaves town to find a place where she fits in and is not judged harshly for being different. She succeeds and returns to bring her younger sibling back with her.

The triangle tattoo is a symbol used to represent the DJ Avicii, however, it has a deeper symbol of nonconformity. Because the triangles are pointed in opposite directions, it illustrates that the sisters are going against society as opposed to conforming to the townspeople’s dull appearance and behavior. For example, the girls seem out of place as they walk through town wearing different color outfits and jewelry. In addition to their bright physical appearance, continuously throughout the music video the lyrics “I didn’t know I was lost” are used to represent that the younger girl did not know she was lost until she realized that she was not like the other townspeople. The little girl goes as far as stating “the others, they don’t like us” during the music video. For this reason the older sister travels through a narrow path in search for a free society. This narrow path depicted in the music video represents that she is leaving a narrow-minded society. It is here that she finds other people with the same nonconformist tattoo. These people with this tattoo were also outcasts that left their hometowns in hopes to live a life of acceptance. Additionally, the video ends with the envious townsperson wishing she was able to join the sisters on their journey and escape the grip of a society filled with close-minded people. You can see in her eyes that she yearns for a life of endless possibilities but does not have the courage to escape.

To me, this music video is a masterpiece, depicting how society has certain expectations and rules that everyone must conform to. If you think differently, dress differently, or behave differently, then you are assigned a label for your non-conformity and are therefore viewed as an outcast. From the time we become aware of how others view us, we are under social pressure not to be different, but to conform. But I have learned that it’s good to rock the boat a bit and be your own person. Being different makes you unique and you’ll always find someone else that accepts you for who you are. Don’t worry about what others think, be yourself!

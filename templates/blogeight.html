<h1>Free Labor</h1>


<p class='blogtext'>
We are a society of data junkies who surf the Internet craving endless amounts of information. We are a new culture that feels the need to constantly be online. We spend countless hours surfing the web and sharing data, yet we get no financial gain for our time and efforts spent sharing our experiences and knowledge. This information that we input can turn into profit for others. Some may consider us "net slaves" as stated in Terranova’s article because of this lack of monetary gain, but I feel that being considered data junkies is more of a cultural aspect to today’s generation (73).

Terranova describes free labor as “the moment where this knowledgeable consumption of culture is translated into excess productive activities that are pleasurably embraced and at the same time often shamelessly exploited” (78).

In other words, we are currently gaining more knowledge from the Internet than from the industrial economy of the past due to all the new technology available. With the digital highway, we now have an abundant amount of collaboration amongst peers who provide information and their knowledge to the public. This digital economy is constantly being utilized because the Internet never turns off. Therefore, with all this knowledge available to the public, there is an excess amount of free time spent on the Internet, collaborating and fostering innovation. For example, people are constantly using their free time to tweet, Facebook, build websites, and use other sites to share experiences and knowledge. While it is enjoyable to spend excessive amounts of time on these sites, our time is exploited by capitalists because these sites are making money from the free exchange of information. Companies like Amazon can make a profit off the time we put in to give their products a good review. Likewise, Open Source programs, which are free and based on the free exchange of application development, are accessed by companies who acquire this free knowledge and charge money for it.

During the industrial economy, the workforce traditionally worked a 40+ hour week, but after work they did not have the ability to access company data or equipment. However, in the digital economy where digital information is accessible 24-7, the workforce has no boundaries. This digital culture is hungry for information and collaboration with others worldwide. The conventional office is therefore a thing of the past and depending on the particular job, there is a good portion of the workforce that can be productive from anywhere in the world as long as they have connectivity to the Internet.

Terranova’s ideas on free labor criticize contemporary trends towards increased flexibility of the workforce. Since there is no off switch on the Internet, we are constantly exchanging information and have the flexibility to freelance and supplement work anywhere and anytime. As we gain more knowledge, continuous reskilling comes into question because with this new technology in the digital economy, there is always more learning and skills to acquire. For this reason, companies are further benefitting from the new skill sets obtained by a workforce at no cost.

In my everyday life I am constantly contributing to free labor by giving food reviews through Foursquare, tweeting news, offering product reviews on amazon, building websites about cyber security, etc. This has become a labor of love and inherent within my generation. It is easy to see how companies like Amazon can exploit this information for economic gain, but even though we are contributing for free, we should not be considered “net slaves” because we are gaining by also having access to the information. Such information gives us a better quality of life by eating at better restaurants, going on better vacations, and buying better products. In addition to providing reviews and opinions, because I attend the University of Michigan, I am also constantly writing, reading, emailing, using the Internet, and chatting online. I have made websites and videos that are all a part of free labor according to Terranova’s definition. Similarly, because I am part of a sorority that is very philanthropic I am constantly raising awareness about different charities on different media sites, which is information that the public should have knowledge about. Therefore, the need to communicate, share opinions, access information about people, places and items are the norm and not the exception.

1. While free labor is negatively viewed in this reading, some people believe that the benefits outweigh the negatives. While some people view free labor as a good thing because it’s an enjoyable part of today’s culture and allows us to obtain endless amounts of information as well as produce it, other people think companies are unfairly gaining from the information we provide. Do you believe that there should be a monetary gain for providing information on the Internet? Do you think it is fair that some businesses make money off the information you provide? Do you think free labor is necessary in order to maintain a capitalistic society?

2. When contributing to the digital community, have you ever thought of yourself as a “net slave?” Do you believe that because you are not making a profit, sharing information can be compared to slavery?
